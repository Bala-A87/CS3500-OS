There was a farmer. He lived in a small village. He had a hen. She gave a golden egg every day. By selling eggs the farmer becomes very rich.

One day he decided to get all the eggs in a single day. The hen was killed but the farmer could not get any Golden egg in its belly. He became very sad and repented for his act.
